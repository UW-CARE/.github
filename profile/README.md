## CARE: Clinician Augmented Reality Environment

In the evolving landscape of surgical specialties, the shift toward minimally invasive procedures has become increasingly prominent, with most surgeries now being guided by imaging techniques such as laparoscopy, endoscopy, or radiography (fluoroscopy). Monitors have become essential for these procedures, yet their placement and visibility present significant challenges in terms of user experience and ergonomics. Augmented reality tools offer a promising solution by allowing the virtual placement of these critical monitors in optimal locations to enhance ergonomics and surgeon comfort. Consequently, operating room staff are continually seeking innovations that simplify the environment, improve the surgical experience, and enhance patient outcomes.
